# Security

The consent service is part of the UnisonOS control plane and manages consent grants and introspection.

For overall security and privacy guidance, including how consent and policy interact, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in unison-consent, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
